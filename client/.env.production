# GOHIP Frontend - Production Environment
# This file is used during the production build
#
# IMPORTANT: Set VITE_API_URL in Railway's environment variables!
# Without this, the app will try to connect to localhost and fail.
#
# Steps to fix:
# 1. Go to Railway Dashboard > Your Frontend Service > Variables
# 2. Add: VITE_API_URL = https://your-backend-service.up.railway.app
# 3. Redeploy the frontend service
#
# Example: https://back-end-production-xxxx.up.railway.app
VITE_API_URL=https://back-end-production.up.railway.app
